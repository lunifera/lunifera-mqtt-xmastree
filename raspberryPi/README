Connect GP1 (in wiringPi numbering) to the transistor for motor control.
Use GP3 as signal for the LED (transistor basis).
Connect GP5 to pin 7 of the Arduino.
Connect GND to the Arduino GND, the LED GND and the motor GND.
Connect 3.3V to the LED transistor collector.

Put these scripts in a folder on your RPi.
You need to have Lua installed on the device.

Change the MQTT broker in 2014.lua to the server you will use.

Start the MQTT client with "lua 2014.lua".
